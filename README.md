# Data-Analysis-on-Hacker-News-Data
In this project, we worked with a data set of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News. 
We performed our analysis on a dataset from the website called ​ ‘Hacker
News’​ . On this website the users submit their stories called ​ ‘posts’​ . These posts can be ​ ‘Ask
HN’​ posts in which the user asks the community about certain things. On the other hand users
can show other members some interesting posts and these types of posts are called ​ ‘Show
HN’​ .
